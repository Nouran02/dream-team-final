<h3>Have you got the key skills graduate employers look for?
 You'll need to give examples of these essential competencies in your job applications and interviews to impress recruiters and get hired.</h3>
Graduate employers place a lot of emphasis on finding candidates with the right skills and competencies for their organisations. Depending on the career sector and profession you choose to work in, there could be very specific skills, abilities and knowledge needed to do the job.

Complementing these are general competencies and behaviours that are essential for successful working. These are the key employability skills â€“ the core skills that will make you effective at work, whatever job you do. They are sometimes known as transferable skills because you develop them over time and take them with you as your career develops; think of them as your passport to career success. You'll need to draw on your work experience to give evidence of these skills.
